It\u0027s much less common in children.\n\nIf you have gum disease, your gums may bleed when you brush your teeth and you may have bad breath. This early stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis.\n\nIf gingivitis isn\u0027t treated, a condition called periodontitis can develop. This affects more tissues that support teeth and hold them in place."
